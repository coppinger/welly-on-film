# Welly on Film - Progress Tracker

## General Work Plan

Building a community-driven analogue film photography platform for Wellington, NZ. The platform enables local photographers to submit film photos across themed categories each month. Three rotating community judges curate 15 images for a small-batch print magazine, while all submissions live on as a digital archive.

**Build Approach:** Frontend-first with static/mock data, then backend integration (Supabase) in Phase 2.
